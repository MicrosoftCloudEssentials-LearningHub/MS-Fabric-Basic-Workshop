This workshop follows two approaches:

1. [Using the Azure Portal](#using-the-azure-portal): This approach involves creating the infrastructure and performing `all necessary steps through the Azure Portal` and its resources interface.
2. `Using Terraform`: This approach focuses on `setting up the required infrastructure via Terraform`. It allows for source control of not only the solution code, connections, and setups `but also the infrastructure itself`.
