### Basic Usage of LangChain Transformer

> `LangChain Transformer helps you automate the process of generating and transforming text data using advanced language models`, making it easier to integrate AI capabilities into your data workflows. <br/>
> 1. `Prompt Creation`: Start by `defining a template for the kind of text you want to generate or analyze`. For example, you might create a prompt that asks the model to define a specific technology term.  <br/>
> 2. `Chain Setup`: Then `set up a chain that links this prompt to a language model`. This chain is responsible for sending the prompt to the model and receiving the generated response.  <br/>
> 3. `Transformer Configuration`: The LangChain Transformer is `configured to use this chain`. It specifies how the `input data (like a list of technology names) should be processed and what kind of output (like definitions) should be produced`.  <br/>
> 4. `Data Processing`: Finally, `apply this setup to a dataset.` E.g., list of technology names in a DataFrame, and the transformer will use the language model to generate definitions for each technology.

1. **Create a Prompt Template**: Define a prompt template for generating definitions.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a3dea8-d743-46e0-a6e9-279aae457bc8">

     ```python
     from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

     copy_prompt = PromptTemplate(
         input_variables=["technology"],
         template="Define the following word: {technology}",
     )
     ```

2. **Set Up an LLMChain**: Create an LLMChain with the defined prompt template.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30a74226-7a02-4c81-a4b1-4039eb43fa9c">

     ```python
     from langchain.chains import LLMChain

     chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=copy_prompt)
     ```

3. **Configure LangChain Transformer**: Set up the LangChain transformer to execute the processing chain.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7d6480a-b75e-449e-808d-ad5a51974af9">

     ```python
    # Set up the LangChain transformer to execute the processing chain.
    from synapse.ml.cognitive.langchain import LangchainTransformer
    
    openai_api_key= os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    
    transformer = (
        LangchainTransformer()
        .setInputCol("technology")
        .setOutputCol("definition")
        .setChain(chain)
        .setSubscriptionKey(openai_api_key)
        .setUrl(api_base)
    )
     ```

4. **Create a Test DataFrame**: Construct a DataFrame with technology names.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2a8e208-6f1d-4cb0-9944-0d2457106b49">


     ```python
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
    from pyspark.sql.types import StringType
    
    # Initialize Spark session
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("example").getOrCreate()
    
    # Construct a DataFrame with technology names
    df = spark.createDataFrame(
        [
            (0, "docker"), (1, "spark"), (2, "python")
        ],
        ["label", "technology"]
    )
    
    # Define a simple UDF to transform the technology column
    def transform_technology(tech):
        return tech.upper()
    
    # Register the UDF
    transform_udf = udf(transform_technology, StringType())
    
    # Apply the UDF to the DataFrame
    transformed_df = df.withColumn("transformed_technology", transform_udf(df["technology"]))
    
    # Show the transformed DataFrame
    transformed_df.show()
     ```

     ```python
    import mlflow
    from mlflow.models import infer_signature
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    
    # Generate synthetic regression data
    X, y = make_regression(n_features=4, n_informative=2, random_state=0, shuffle=False)
    
    # Model parameters
    params = {"n_estimators": 3, "random_state": 42}
    
    # Model tags for MLflow
    model_tags = {
        "project_name": "grocery-forecasting",
        "store_dept": "produce",
        "team": "stores-ml",
        "project_quarter": "Q3-2023"
    }
    
    # Log MLflow entities
    with mlflow.start_run() as run:
        # Train the model
        model = RandomForestRegressor(**params).fit(X, y)
    
        # Infer the model signature
        signature = infer_signature(X, model.predict(X))
    
        # Log parameters and the model
        mlflow.log_params(params)
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, artifact_path="sklearn-model", signature=signature)
    
        # Register the model with tags
        model_uri = f"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/sklearn-model"
        model_version = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "RandomForestRegressionModel", tags=model_tags)
    
        # Output model registration details
        print(f"Model Name: {model_version.name}")
        print(f"Model Version: {model_version.version}")
     ```

2. **Compare and Filter Machine Learning Models**: Use MLflow to search among multiple models saved within the workspace.

     ```python
    from pprint import pprint
    from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient
    
    client = MlflowClient()
    for rm in client.search_registered_models():
        pprint(dict(rm), indent=4)
     ```
